1. Currently, the system only allows for modification of CONSTRAINT blocks. If one wants to modify more types of blocks, they
need to be added to cards.editable(). Other cards may (will) require special parsing as PFLOTRAN has a much more complex
structure than CrunchTope. All other blocks not in this list are copy and pasted from template.verbatim

2. This also means that currently you can not modify anything in the SIMULATION block.

3. Nesting structure of PFLOTRAN is difficult to deal with. Currently, only one skip-noskip is allowed per block.

4. A 'block' (i.e. card) for the purposes defined here is anything that ends with an END statement. A \ does not
consitute the end of a block.
    4.1 Duplicate \ in a block relies on an expoit where PFLOTRAN doesn't mind if you mangle \ with characters afterwards.
